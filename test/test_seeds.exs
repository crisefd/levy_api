# Script for populating the database. You can run it as:
#
#     mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
#
# Inside the script, you can read and write to any of your
# repositories directly:
#
#     LevyApi.Repo.insert!(%LevyApi.SomeSchema{})
#
# We recommend using the bang functions (`insert!`, `update!`
# and so on) as they will fail if something goes wrong.

# alias LevyApi.Accounts.User
# alias LevyApi.Accounts
# alias LevyApi.Repo

# Dummy John Doe user

# Accounts.create_user(%{username: "john.doe@dummy.com", name: "John", surname: "Doe"})
